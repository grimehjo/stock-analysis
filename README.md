# stock-analysis

In this exercise I analysed different green stocks using VBA.

## Deliverable 2: Written Analysis of Results

### Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

In this exercise I analysed different green stocks using VBA for an individual named Steve, whose parents are interested in investing money into environmentally friendly stocks.

I first analysed the stocks of only one company with the ticker symbol of DQ. DQ was the stock the family were first interested in investing, but unfortunately the returns were discovered to be pretty bad for this stock after doing an analysis using VBA. Because of this, they decided that they would actually like to look at all the stocks available in the data to see if there are any better options.

Because of this, I then created a VBA code to analyse all the stocks at once. I then made the data interactive by letting the user to be able to analyse the stocks by year.


### Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

### Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
#### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
#### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
